				</section>

				<section>

					<h2>Bayer-Monsanto Deal</h2>
					<p>Negotiation is ongoing, pending regulatory approval</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Fierce negotiation on price</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">We assume some potential issues have been faced in previous rounds, or they could face in the final rounds of negotiations</p>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Cultural Differences</h2>
					<p>First, the differences in culture between U.S. and Germany</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Different negotiation tactics, may be reason why it took four rounds of negotiations to come to an agreement</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">U.S. negotiators have a forceful, urgent, result-orinted style</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Germans appreciate directness and clarity and suspicious of vagueness</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Cultural Differences</h2>
					<p>German representatives need time to evaluate positions</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">They cannot be rushed</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Blunt and confrontational - May have been a problem in Bayer - Monsanto talks</p>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Cultural Differences</h2>
					<p>American habit of going over the positive sides before addressing real issues</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Confusing for Germans</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">The share price increase may be a token of amends for bad negotiation interactions - although not the only reason</p>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Cultural Differences</h2>
					<p>Germans take long vacations during June, July, August</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Deal talks started in May</p>
					<h3 class="fragment fade-up">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<blockquote>Not understanding the differences between cultures, and not taking those differences into consideration in planning a negotiation can have disastrous consequences. </blockquote>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Who's really a party?</h2>
					<p>Underestimating or not considering all parties with interests in this negotiation </p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Bayer, Monsanto, regulators in 30 countries were present</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Environmental organizations, farmers, not in the deal</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">They are very unhappy with the potential merger</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Who's really a party?</h2>
					<p>Groups such as Pesticide Action Network (PAN) - actively lobbying against the merger</p>
					<blockquote class="fragment fade-up">
						Just six corporations already dominate worldwide seed and pesticide markets. Additional consolidation will increase prices and further limit choices for farmers
					</blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Who's really a party?</h2>
					<p>Farmers against it since new giant will have 2/3 of the agrochemical market control</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Complaints on less choice in the market (meaning price increase)</p>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Who's really a party?</h2>
					<p>Department of Justice may be opposing the merger</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">NGOs lobbying against the merger to DoJ</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">DoJ may be backing up the farmers</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Who's really a party?</h2>
					<p>Neither Monsanto nor Bayer really planned for a DoJ block</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">It's unknown whether they anticipated such strong opposition</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">No one knows how they will respond to the opposition</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>Both companies agreed to the deal but it's not final yet</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Bayer - not anticipated the power of lobbying</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Deal - waiting to be approved by anti-trust regulators</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>Deal is far from over</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Lack of proper due diligence in the planning phase - proved harder than Bayer anticipated</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Bayer willing to spend whatever is necessary to get the deal</p>
